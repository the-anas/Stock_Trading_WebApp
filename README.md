# Stock Trading WebApp
This project is my implementation of the CS50x week 9 problem set. 

This project is a web application that allows you, after making an account and logging in, to virtually trade stocks. Its backend is built using
Flask and SQLite. 

To run the web application locally, install all the requirements and then use the command 'Flask run'.

Note that distribution code was provided. To view the distribution code or learn more about this project,
